1.history -- 
	Browser router obj looks url in address bar and extracts it and sends it browser router

2.browser router
	passes history to route component

3.route component
	compares path and history and renders component


note -- single path can be matched by multiple routes
	
     -- exact - strict match the route so that the component only renders to it
