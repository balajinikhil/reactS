Navigate in App
	
import {BrowserRouter, Route, Link} from "react-router-dom"


<Link to="/" /> (replace <a> tag)


Three types of routing 

1.BrowserRouter
2.HashRouter
3.MemoryRouter


BrowserRouter 
    -tracks the route change in browser and history of BrowserRouter tacks the changes and updates the component what to render

HashRouter
    -adds an hash in before specified route, ex- http://www.example.com/#/about,
    works same as HashRouter.

MemoryRouter
    -doesnot change anything in url and keeps track of the route and won't show any route
