Types of navigation

-intentional navigation(user clicks on a link component)
-Programmatic navigation(we run code to forcibly navigate the user through our app)

historry - obj keeps track of address in our browser
BrowserRouter - listens to history for changes to the URL

only components of Route will have acess to history object so if we want to make changes to it outside the route component 
we have to pass it as parameter to that obj.

we can create our own history object and plain router and control the changes in the history 


src
	-history.js

import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history'

export default createBrowserHistory()

replace BrowserRouter with Router 


history.push("/route") --to make navigate
