component isolation
	
	1.user types url 
	2.user loads up our app
	3.redux state obj is empty
	4.we try to select stream with id '3' from state
	5. no stream were loaded so we get undefined 
	6.we navigate to "/"
	7.StreamList fetches all of our streams, updates Redux 	state
	8.we navigate back to "/streams/edit/3"
	9.we select stream with id of 3
	10.data is now in redux store so we see the appropriate stream


React-Router, each component needs to be designed to work in isolation(fetch its own data!)


setIntitial value
	
	1.StreamEdit
		-onSubmit
		-intialValue
	2.ReduxForm
	(StreamForm)

--StreamCreate
import editStream from actions
onSubmit=>log(val)

reduxForm wrapped StreamForm	

<StreamForm intialValues={obj} />
obj contains intial values with key as name and value as property.

_.pick(obj, 'key') //this picks the particular key and value and return new obj with only those fields
