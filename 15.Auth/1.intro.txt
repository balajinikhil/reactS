Types of Authentication

    1.Email/Password Authentication
        -We store a record in DB with user's email and Password
        -WHen the user tries to login we compare email/pwd with stored in DB
        -A user is logged in when they enter correct email/pwd
    
    2.O_Auth Authentication
        -User authenticates with outside service provider
        -User authorises our app to access their information
        -Outside provider tell us about the user
        -We are trusting the outside provider to correctly handel identification of user
        -O_Auth can be used for (1) User identification in our app (2) our app making actions on behalf of user

Different O_Auth

    1. O_Auth for servers
        -Result in a token that server can use to make request on behalf of user
        -Usually used when we have an app that needs to access user data when they are not logged in
        -Difficult to setup because we need to store a lot of info about the user

    2.O_Auth for JS Browser Apps
        -Result in token that a Browser app can use to make request on behalf of the user
        -Usually used when we have an app that only needs to access user data while they are logged in
        -Very easy to setup thanks to google's js lib to automate the flow
