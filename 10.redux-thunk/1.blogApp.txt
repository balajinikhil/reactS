npm i redux react-redux axios redux-thunk

redux -> redux library
react-redux -> integration layer b/w react and redux 
axios -> help us make network requests
redux-thunk -> middelware to help us make requests in a redux app
		

Fetch data to redux
	Component gets rendered onto the screen
	Component's componentDidMount lifecycle method will be called
	We call action creator from componentDidMount
	Action creator runs code to make an API request
	API responds with data
	Action creator returns an action with fetched data on the payload property
	Some reducer sees the action, returns the data off the payload	
	Because we generated some new state object, redux/react-redux cause our React app to be rendered

-Components are generally responsible for fetching data they need by calling an action creator
-Action creators are responsible for making API requests(redux-thunk)
-We get fetched data component by generating new state in our redux store then getting that throug mapStateToProps
