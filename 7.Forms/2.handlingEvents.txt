Controlled
	-value of the dom will be undercontroll of react state

Uncontrolled
	-Only html element is under controll of the react state

this
	what? - points to the instance which is creating it
	How? - the value is determined by instance which is created it.

How to overcome?
	-Binding inside a constructor
	this.func = this.fun.bind(this);

	-Arrow function
	this points to parent scope in arrow function
	
	-Func inside jsx only
	(e)=>this.executeFUnc(e)


Comunicating Child to Parent
	Send func as props and return value to that func in child
