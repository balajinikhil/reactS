Rules of reducers
	1.Must return any value besides "undefined".
	2.Produces state/data to be used inside of app using only previous state and action.
	3.Must not reach out of itself to decide what value to return (reducers are pure).
	4.Must not mutate it's input state argument.

Mutation 
	Changing the origin value, by adding new values of our own
	ex- arr.push(val)
	    obj.prop = val	

note- String and numbers are imutable values
      === compares value in memory not the value

If we mutate the state the redux can't determine the change and re-render dosen't happen
