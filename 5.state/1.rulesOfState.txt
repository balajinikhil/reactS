Rules Of State
	-Only usable with class components
	-You will confuse props with state :(
	-"State" is a js object that contains some amount of data that is relevant to singular component.
	-Updating state on a component will cause the component to instantly rerender
	-State must be intialized when a component is created
	-State can only be updated using the function "setState"


Intialize state
	-in construtor of class
	

	class ComponentName extends React.Component{
	constructor(props){
		super(props);
		this.state = {key:val}	
	}	
	}

i.e super -is a ref to parent's constructor
